%%            Please verify your thesis' formatting and copyright

%% The documentclass options along with the pagestyle can be used to generate
%% a technical report, a draft copy, or a regular thesis. You may need to
%% re-specify the pagestyle after you \include cover.tex. For more
%% information, see the first few lines of mitthesis.cls.
