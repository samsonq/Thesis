# Abstract
Advancements in computing capabilities have enabled machine learning algorithms to
learn directly from large amounts of data. Deep reinforcement learning is a particu-
larly powerful method that uses agents to learn by interacting with an environment of
data. Although many traders and investment managers rely on traditional statistical
and stochastic methods to price assets and develop trading and hedging strategies,
deep reinforcement learning has proven to be an effective method to learn optimal
policies for pricing and hedging. Machine learning removes the need for various para-
metric assumptions about underlying market dynamics by learning directly from data.
This research examines the use of machine learning methods to develop a data-driven
method of derivatives pricing and dynamic hedging. Nevertheless, machine learning
methods like reinforcement learning require an abundance of data to learn. We explore
the implementation of a generative adversarial network-based approach to generate
realistic market data from past historical data. This data is used to train the rein-
forcement learning framework and evaluate its robustness. The results demonstrate
the efficacy of deep reinforcement learning methods to price derivatives and hedge
positions in the proposed systematic GAN-based market simulation framework.
