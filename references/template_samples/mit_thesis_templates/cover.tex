\title{An Optimizing Compiler for Low-Level Floating Point Operations}

\author{Lucien William Van Elsen}
% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the 
% previous degrees command:
%       \prevdegrees{A.A., Harvard University (1985)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\
%                    S.M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981)}
\department{Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September, 
% February, or June.  The default is June.

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.  
%\copyrightnoticetext{\copyright IBM, 1990.  Do not open till Xmas.}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.
\supervisor{William J. Dally}{Associate Professor}

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee
% Chairman.
\chairman{Arthur C. Smith}{Chairman, Department Committee on Graduate Theses}

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}
% \begin{abstractpage}
% \input{abstract}
% \end{abstractpage}
