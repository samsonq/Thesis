In this thesis, I designed and implemented a compiler which performs
optimizations that reduce the number of low-level floating point operations
necessary for a specific task; this involves the optimization of chains of
floating point operations as well as the implementation of a ``fixed'' point
data type that allows some floating point operations to simulated with integer
arithmetic.  The source language of the compiler is a subset of C, and the
destination language is assembly language for a micro-floating point CPU.  An
instruction-level simulator of the CPU was written to allow testing of the
code.  A series of test pieces of codes was compiled, both with and without
optimization, to determine how effective these optimizations were.
