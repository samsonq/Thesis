To comment out part of an entry in BibTeX, you can use:

	@Comment{body of text}

If you wish to comment out the entire entry, just remove the @ sign in
front of the entry type (i.e., get rid of the '@' in "@Book").

*************************************************************************

You can specify fixed strings (say if you needed to use it multiple
times in your BibTeX file) with the @String command:

	@String(Leslie-Lamport = {Leslie Lamport})

and then you could use it in various entries:

	@Book{latex,
		Author = Leslie-Lamport,
		Title = "\LaTeX",
		...
		Year = "1993"}

*************************************************************************

The required fields are not prefaced with OPT.  Those that are optional
*are* prefaced with OPT (remember to delete those three characters should
you wish to use those fields).

[Note:
     For most entry types the "author" information is simply the AUTHOR
field.  However:  For the @Book and @Inbook entry types it's the AUTHOR
field, but if there's no author then it's the EDITOR field; for the
@Manual entry type it's the AUTHOR field, but if there's no author then
it's the ORGANIZATION field; and for the @Proceedings entry type it's
the EDITOR filed, but if there's no editor then it's the ORGANIZATION
field.]

To use this, just have your main.tex specify the following:

	\bibliography{main}
	\bibliographystyle{plain}

There are several options for bibliographystyle:

        plain   normal style - listed in ABC order and labeled numerically
        unsrt   same as plain except entries appear in order of citation
        alpha   same as plain except entry labels are used
        abbrv   same as plain except uses abbreviations for first names,
                month names, and journal names

Now that you have the basis for a bibliography, you have to run both
latex and bibtex on the document.  First, you should run latex (to
create a foo.aux file, which bibtex reads).  Then run bibtex once to get
some of the citations and create a .bbl file.  Then run latex again so
that the cross references between the text file and the bibliography are
correct.  You may want to repeat running bibtex and latex on the file to
make sure that all cross references are correct.  Be warned that
adding/deleting citations and sources will require running bibtex again.
